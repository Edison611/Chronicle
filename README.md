## Project Vision
Chronicle lets you explore stories through an interactive timeline, revealing characters' emotions and perspectives at any moment, with the ability to chat with them for deeper insight.

## Project Description
Chronicle is a web app designed to help you explore stories through the lens of perspective. By analyzing any book or story, it reveals each character’s sentiments and personality at specific moments, allowing users to drag characters onto an interactive timeline to see the world through their eyes. Powered by generative AI and sentiment analysis, Chronicle also enables real-time conversations with the characters, offering a unique way to understand their emotions, motivations, and experiences—deepening your appreciation of the diverse perspectives that shape every story.

Imagine reading a book or article and not just following the plot, but diving into the perspectives of the characters — exploring their thoughts, emotions, and motivations at key moments. Chronicle transforms any text into an interactive timeline and allowing you to learn about a character’s emotions and insights into their personal experiences at any point in the story. At its core, Chronicle is about perspective. Stories aren’t just sequences of events but collections of individual experiences, shaped by context, emotions, and beliefs.

## How It Works
We first allow a user to upload a pdf of any story of their choosing
Next, we use AI to characterize all of the important characters in the story as well as any dialogue that is relevant to them
With this information, a user can select a character and view their perspective at a specific time in the story
Their perspective is generated from their personality analyzed from all moments prior as well as their emotion which comes from data from recent events
Finally, we provide a feature where users can chat with the character at the specific time in the story to understand their perspectives
Challenges we ran into
Limited computational speed at low-cost, so we chose to use DeepSink that provides fast AI solutions for a low price
Similar character names that cause the same vector embeddings were another challenge that was difficult to solve

## More Info
Chronicle uses Gen AI and sentiment analysis to analyze text and extract characters' thoughts and emotions at specific moments in a story using machine learning with Python. With a React-powered front end, Chronicle can visualize characters on an interactive timeline. By simply dragging a character to a specific point in the story, you can uncover their sentiments, motivations, and perspectives at that moment.

Chronicle goes further by allowing you to chat with the characters themselves using Gen AI from DeepSeek. Every character brings a unique viewpoint shaped by their background, values, and emotions. Engaging with these perspectives fosters empathy, enabling us to connect with others on a deeper emotional level. Empathy helps us understand pain, joy, and desires — building compassion, resolving conflicts, and creating more meaningful connections.

In a polarized world, understanding multiple perspectives can break down barriers. Chronicle reminds us that everyone’s story is shaped by unique experiences and struggles, encouraging non-judgmental listening and greater compassion. By immersing ourselves in diverse perspectives, we gain a richer, more nuanced view of the world.

In the end, Chronicle isn’t just about stories — it’s about cultivating empathy and transforming how we connect with each other in a world that desperately needs it.
